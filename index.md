## 👩🏻‍💻 What I'm doing

This summer, I'm participating in Google's [Computer Science Summer Institute](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/computer-science-summer-institute/), being mentored as part of the BUILT BY GIRLS [WAVE Program](https://www.builtbygirls.com/about-wave), and TAing for a coding / USACO camp.

This fall, I'll be attending Stanford University, where I plan to study some combination of tech and the humanities. I'm especially interested in data politics, AI ethics, and algorithmic bias.

## 🦕 What I've done before

In high school, I competed in coding contests, built mobile apps, and interned at [J.B. Hunt](https://www.jbhunt.com), a Fortune-500 logistics company located in Northwest Arkansas. I was a [WWDC Scholar](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc19/scholarships/) and a member of USACO's Gold Division, and my coding team "She++" became the first all-women team to win the Arkansas High School Programming Competition in its 20+ year history.

I also co-founded [Allgirlithm](https://www.allgirlithm.org), an organization dedicated to making AI more accessible.

## 🤪 Fun facts

- My full name (sans whitespace) is a prefix of "Annelid", an "elongated segmented coelomate invertebrate" (source: [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/annelid))
- Once, I substituted ghost-pepper sauce for chili oil while cooking dandanmian; tasting it made liquid stream from all my facial orifices simultaneously
