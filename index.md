## 👩🏻‍💻 What I'm doing

This summer, I'm participating in Google's [Computer Science Summer Institute](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/computer-science-summer-institute/), being mentored as part of the BUILT BY GIRLS [WAVE Program](https://www.builtbygirls.com/about-wave), and TAing for a coding / USACO camp.

This fall, I'll be attending Stanford University, where I plan to study some combination of tech and humanities. I'm especially interested in data politics, AI ethics, and algorithmic bias.

## 🦕 What I've done before

Last summer, I interned at [Repl.it](https://repl.it/), an online code editor supporting 50+ programming languages & a community of 2 million makers.

During high school, I organized [hackathons](http://mahacks.com/) & attempted bioinformatics research. I founded [Science and Us](http://scienceandus.org/) to introduce teens to the careers and anti-disciplinary mindset of science communication.

When I was 11, I loved Percy Jackson so much I ended up self-studying Modern Greek for 3 years, running a [linguistics Tumblr](http://subjunctivelymoody.tumblr.com/), and teaching myself Latin.
